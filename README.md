# Draw This
Welcome to the Draw This project, let's get started!

### What is the Draw This porject ?
It's pretty simple, the Draw This project helps find photos for art/creative inspiration with the help of words for choice of the photos suggested by you.

### How does it work ?
Draw This is currently only on twitter , so you need to be on the platform. Simply relpy to our latest tweet with a single word which will be your suggestion. There will be four words chosen based on the amount of likes ( ❤️ ) the replies get. Don't forget to like your own suggestion as we only take replies with al least one like ( ❤️ )!. The photos will then be chosen based on those words and will be presentd in the next post/tweet. 

### Where do these Photos come from, and how are they chosen ?
The photos are currently only provided by [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com).
