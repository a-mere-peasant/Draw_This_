# Draw This
Welcome to the Draw This project, let's get started!

Please follow our page to get notified when we post on our twitter page here : [Draw_This_](https://twitter.com/Draw_This_) (@Draw_This_) .Have fun drawing and creating!

### What is the Draw This project ?
It's pretty simple, the Draw This project helps find photos for art/creative inspiration with the help of words for choice of the photos suggested by you.

### How does it work ?
Draw This is currently only on twitter , so you need to be on the platform. Simply relpy to our latest tweet with a single word which will be your suggestion. There will be four words chosen based on the amount of likes ( ❤️ ) the replies get. Don't forget to like your own suggestion as we only take replies with al least one like ( ❤️ )!. The photos will then be chosen based on those words and will be presentd in the next post/tweet. 

### Where do these Photos come from, and how are they chosen ?
The photos are currently only provided by [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com).I are really thankful to them for providing such nice photos by these awesome photographers.The words that are chosen are searched for on pexels , and a random image is chosen from the result.

### What can I suggest?
All suggestions consist of a single word only, and they should be in reply to the latest tweet(unless othrewise specified).Please be respectful in the suggestions and do not chose offensive words.

### Can I give more than one worded suggestions?
No, we only support one worded suggestions at the time.

### When will the next post/tweet come out?
This remains a mystery, the amount of tweets/posts and their timings will be random,this makes it more fun. Please follow the page to get notified whenever they come out.

### What if there are no words?
If there are no words, then random photos are chosen.

### What if there are less than 4 words?
If there are less than 4 words, then the remaining photos will be chosen randomly.

### Why do I see a word ,but not a corresponding image?
If there are no images in the result corresponding to a word, then the word will be displayed but a random image will be chosen.So you can even chose made up words.Again, please consider that the words do not imply any offensive meaning. 

### How do I setup something like this?
I am using the twitter and pexels api with the pypexels wrapper. You need to get your own keys and make a keys.py to store them.I'll try to put all development related info in the wiki, but that will take some time.
Edit: Work on wiki is almost complete for the current version.
